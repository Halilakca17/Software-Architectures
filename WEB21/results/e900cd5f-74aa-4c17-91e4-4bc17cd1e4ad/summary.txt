a lot of students are skipping on Fridays . it might be good if we did something like a pancake breakfast to encourage them to come . I think that's a great idea. let's try that next week . he's been dealing with helping his parents take care of his younger siblings during the day . it might actually be a good idea if he spoke to the guidance counselor a little bit . I'll look for some free or low-cost resources in the community to share with John and can share them with his family .
