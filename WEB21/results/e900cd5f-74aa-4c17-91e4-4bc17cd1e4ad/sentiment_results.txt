Cümle: I've heard some of my mentees talking about how it's really hard to get out of bed on Fridays.

Cümle: It might be good if we did something like a pancake breakfast to encourage them to come.
Duygu: joy, Güven: 0.91

Cümle: I think that's a great idea.
Duygu: joy, Güven: 0.99

Cümle: Let's try that next week.

Cümle: It might also be because a lot of students have been getting sick now that it's getting colder outside.

Cümle: I've had a number of students come by my office with symptoms like sniffling and coughing.
Duygu: sadness, Güven: 0.77

Duygu: neutral, Güven: 0.89

Cümle: Like, you know, wash your hands after the bathroom.
Duygu: neutral, Güven: 0.86

Cümle: Stuff like that.
Duygu: neutral, Güven: 0.61

Cümle: I think that's a good idea and it'll be a good reminder for the teachers as well.

Cümle: So one other thing I wanted to talk about, there's a student I've noticed here, John Smith.
